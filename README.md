# testdouble/feedback

Have a question, criticism, or something you'd like to discuss with the test double team? Just open a [New Issue](https://github.com/testdouble/feedback/issues/new) on this repo, and we can have a dialog about it.

We'd love if you asked us about the work we do—whether it's about [Lineman](http://linemanjs.com), a [blog post](http://blog.testdouble.com) we wrote, a software practice we talk about, or about how [we've had success working remotely](http://testdouble.com/agency.html).

## Wait, what?

This repo was inspired by [@holman](https://github.com/holman)'s [feedback repo](https://github.com/holman/feedback) as a way to promote conversations about software in a public space from which everyone could benefit. In particular, we've recently seen a huge uptick in thoughtful and reasonable questions about how we work via e-mail, but we'd rather be able to include multiple participants and reference them later than continue to tackle each question on a 1-on-1 basis.

Several of our open source projects span dozens of repos at this point, so having a central place to discuss them was also becoming apparent (people with simple curiosities, for example, often feel uncomfortable opening an issue on the project's repo directly). Anyone should feel free raising any curiosity here without fear of being shamed for asking the wrong thing or doing it in the wrong place.

## I'm uncomfortable asking my question in public

If you're not comfortable—for any reason at all—asking a question that will be publicly visible, please feel free to e-mail us [hello@testdouble.com](mailto:hello@testdouble.com)
